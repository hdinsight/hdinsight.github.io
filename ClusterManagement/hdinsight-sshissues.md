# I can't log in to my cluster

## **Recommended steps**
 To resolve common issues, try one or more of the following steps.  Keep in mind that when logging in to the cluster or app dashboards, use your "cluster login" or "HTTP" credentials.  When connecting remotely, use your Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop credentials.
 
 1. Try opening the [cluster dashboard](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_HDInsight.DashboardBlade) in a new browser tab in privacy mode.
 2. For Linux clusters, if you cannot recall your SSH credentials, you can [reset the credentials within the Ambari UI](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/hdinsight-administer-use-portal-linux/#change-passwords).  For Windows clusters, you can change your credentials by opening the Cluster Login or Remote Desktop settings in the portal.
